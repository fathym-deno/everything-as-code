# Everything as Code (EaC) - Fathym

Welcome to the **Everything as Code (EaC)** directory of the Fathym platform. This directory contains the **core types** that form the foundation of the EaC schema. These types serve as building blocks that must be **extended** to create modules (schemas) with the EaC. While these core types do not provide direct functionality, they define the structure necessary to build tailored solutions.

## Overview

The **Everything as Code (EaC)** schema is a flexible and scalable framework designed to help users orchestrate and automate workflows across their enterprise. Examples of prebuilt modules—such as infrastructure, applications, data, and AI—are available, but the system also supports the creation of custom modules to meet specific needs.

By extending the core types provided in this directory, developers can build custom modules or utilize existing ones, bringing the full functionality of the EaC system to life. These modules streamline processes like infrastructure management, application deployment, data workflows, AI systems, and more.

## Key Features

- **Core Schema**: Provides the essential types that form the foundation for all EaC modules.
- **Extensibility**: Developers can extend these core types to create custom modules or use existing ones for managing infrastructure, applications, data, AI, and more.
- **Declarative Approach**: The schema enables a declarative management style, making environments easier to configure, scale, and integrate.
- **Enterprise Workflows**: Use prebuilt or custom modules to orchestrate and automate diverse workflows across your enterprise.

This directory provides the **core types** necessary to create modules (schemas) with the EaC. These types can be extended to build custom solutions or used alongside prebuilt modules to automate workflows across infrastructure, applications, data, AI, and other enterprise processes.
