# Clouds Module - Everything as Code (EaC)

Welcome to the **Clouds Module** within the **Everything as Code (EaC)** framework. This module provides the foundational types and functionality for managing cloud infrastructure as part of the broader EaC ecosystem. By using the Clouds Module, users can define, orchestrate, and automate cloud-native infrastructure through declarative code, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and consistency in cloud resource management.

## Overview

The **Clouds Module** allows users to define and manage their cloud infrastructure in a code-driven manner. By leveraging the EaC schema, users can configure cloud resources, automate their provisioning, and integrate infrastructure management seamlessly into enterprise workflows. The module supports a wide range of cloud services, enabling organizations to manage cloud environments across different providers with a unified approach.

Whether youâ€™re deploying new cloud resources, scaling existing ones, or automating infrastructure processes, the Clouds Module provides the core types needed to build custom infrastructure workflows or use existing ones within the EaC system.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Define and manage cloud infrastructure resources through code, ensuring repeatable and consistent deployments.
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Use the Clouds Module to manage resources across various cloud providers, integrating different environments within a single, unified workflow.
- **Automation**: Automate the provisioning, scaling, and management of cloud resources, streamlining infrastructure operations.
- **Integration with EaC Ecosystem**: Works seamlessly with other modules (applications, data, AI) to orchestrate end-to-end enterprise workflows, with cloud infrastructure as the foundation.
- **Extensibility**: Extend the core types and functionality to create custom cloud workflows, supporting diverse infrastructure needs.
- **Scalability**: Scale cloud resources dynamically based on application demand or operational requirements using declarative configurations.
