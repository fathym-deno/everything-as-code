# DFS Module - Everything as Code (EaC)

Welcome to the **DFS Module** within the **Everything as Code (EaC)** framework. This module provides the foundation for managing distributed file systems (DFS) within the EaC ecosystem. By using this module, users can define, orchestrate, and automate workflows for managing files and data across distributed systems, integrating file storage and retrieval into broader enterprise workflows.

## Overview

The **DFS Module** allows users to manage distributed file systems (DFS) through a declarative, code-driven approach. It supports file storage, retrieval, and management across various distributed systems, making it easy to integrate DFS operations into workflows for infrastructure, applications, and data management. Whether you're handling large-scale file storage or complex file system workflows, this module provides the core types needed to build both custom and prebuilt DFS solutions.

With the DFS Module, you can manage file systems across cloud providers or on-premise environments, leveraging the EaC ecosystem to orchestrate and automate complex file workflows.

## Key Features

- **Declarative DFS Management**: Define and manage distributed file systems through code, ensuring repeatable and consistent file storage operations.
- **File Storage and Retrieval**: Automate the storage and retrieval of files across distributed systems, making it easy to scale file management for enterprise environments.
- **Integration with EaC Ecosystem**: Works with other modules—such as infrastructure, applications, and data—to build end-to-end workflows that incorporate distributed file systems.
- **Extensibility**: Extend the module to create custom workflows for managing distributed file systems, integrating seamlessly with cloud-native and on-premise file solutions.
- **Support for Distributed Systems**: The module supports the integration of various distributed file storage systems, allowing for flexibility across cloud providers and storage technologies.
- **Automation**: Automate file management tasks such as file transfers, backups, and scaling file storage dynamically based on your application needs.

## Getting Started

1. **Define DFS Configurations**: Use the core types in the DFS Module to define configurations for your distributed file systems, including storage rules, file retrieval processes, and integration points.
2. **Automate File Workflows**: Leverage prebuilt or custom workflows to automate file storage, retrieval, and scaling across distributed environments.
3. **Integrate with Other Modules**: Combine the DFS Module with other EaC modules (e.g., applications, data, infrastructure) to create full workflows that handle file management as part of your overall system architecture.
4. **Scale Distributed File Systems**: Use the module to manage the scaling of file systems based on application and data growth, integrating both cloud and on-premise storage solutions.
