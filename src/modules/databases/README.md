# Databases Module - Everything as Code (EaC)

Welcome to the **Databases Module** within the **Everything as Code (EaC)** framework. This module provides the foundation for managing and automating database configurations, connections, and workflows as part of the EaC ecosystem. It allows users to define, provision, and manage databases in a code-driven manner, integrating database operations seamlessly into broader enterprise workflows.

## Overview

The **Databases Module** enables users to define, configure, and manage databases through a declarative, code-first approach. It supports database provisioning, schema management, and connection handling, allowing you to integrate database workflows into the larger infrastructure, application, and data pipelines managed by Everything as Code. 

Whether you are managing relational databases, NoSQL databases, or other data storage solutions, this module provides the core types and functions necessary for both prebuilt and custom database workflows. The module’s extensibility also supports diverse enterprise database environments, making it easy to scale, automate, and manage database systems as part of a unified, code-driven approach.

## Getting Started

1. **Define Database Configurations**: Use the core types in the Databases Module to define database schemas, provisioning rules, and connection parameters.
2. **Automate Database Workflows**: Leverage prebuilt workflows or create custom automation for database provisioning, schema updates, and scaling.
3. **Integrate with Other Modules**: Combine the Databases Module with other EaC modules, like applications and infrastructure, to create full enterprise workflows that integrate databases seamlessly.
4. **Support for Diverse Database Types**: Extend the module to manage different types of databases, from relational systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to NoSQL solutions (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
