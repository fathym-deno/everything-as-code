# Applications Module - Everything as Code (EaC)

Welcome to the **Applications Module** within the **Everything as Code (EaC)** framework. This module provides the foundation for managing and automating the deployment, configuration, and orchestration of applications in a cloud-native environment. It is part of the broader EaC ecosystem, which enables users to define and automate their entire enterprise infrastructure through code.

---

## Overview

The **Applications Module** allows users to define, deploy, and manage applications using a declarative, code-driven approach. It integrates seamlessly with other EaC modules—such as infrastructure, data, and AI—to create end-to-end workflows for managing cloud-native applications at scale.

In the **Applications Module**, **Projects** provide a configuration of how applications are hosted, including which paths they are available on and the hosts from which they can be accessed. **Applications**, in turn, define the specific configuration for which processor handles each application. Examples of processors include:

- **Redirect Processor**: Handles URL redirection.
- **Proxy Processor**: Forwards requests to a different server or service.
- **API Processor**: Manages API endpoints.
- **Preact Islands Processor**: Handles server-side rendering for Preact Islands architecture.
- **OAuth Processor**: Manages authentication through OAuth protocols.

Additionally, the **Applications Module** leverages a **micro frontends architecture**, allowing for applications built in various frameworks to be served seamlessly. This approach supports flexible integration, enabling developers to build applications in any number of frameworks and serve them cohesively within the same environment.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Application Management**: Define and manage applications and their hosting configurations through code, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments.
- **Project-Based Hosting Configurations**: Projects define how applications are hosted, including their paths and the hosts they are accessible from.
- **Processor-Based Application Handling**: Applications specify which processor (e.g., Redirect, Proxy, API, Preact Islands, OAuth) manages the request routing and execution.
- **Micro Frontends Support**: Serve applications built in any framework using a micro frontends architecture, ensuring flexibility and scalability in application delivery.
- **Integration with EaC Ecosystem**: Works alongside other modules (infrastructure, data, AI) to create seamless workflows across your enterprise.
- **Scalability**: Supports scaling applications automatically or on-demand, with code-driven configurations.
- **Extensibility**: Extend the core types and functionality to create custom workflows for application deployment and management.
- **Automation**: Automate deployment, updates, and scaling of applications as part of a broader Everything as Code process.

## Getting Started

1. **Define Hosting Configurations in Projects**: Set up the paths and hosts where your applications will be available.
2. **Configure Application Processors**: Specify which processor (Redirect, Proxy, API, Preact Islands, OAuth, etc.) will handle each application.
3. **Leverage Micro Frontends**: Build applications in any framework and serve them seamlessly within the same environment.
4. **Integrate with Other Modules**: Combine the Applications Module with other EaC modules like infrastructure or data to orchestrate full enterprise workflows.

The **Applications Module** simplifies and automates the process of managing cloud-native applications, from configuring how they are hosted to specifying the processors that handle their functionality. With support for micro frontends, this module enables you to deliver applications built in various frameworks while ensuring smooth integration into broader Everything as Code workflows.
